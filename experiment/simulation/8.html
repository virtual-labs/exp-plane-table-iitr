    <p id="tele_alida_para">It is used for taking long and/or inclined sights. It consists of a small telescope with a level tube and
vertical graduated arc mounted on horizontal axis. All the parts are finally supported on a heavy ruler
base, one side of which is graduated to measure the distance on Plane Table. Horizontal distance
between the plane table and object sighted through telescope can be computed by taking stadia
readings on the staff kept at the object.
